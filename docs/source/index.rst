Welcome to PtyDash's documentation!
===================================

PtyDash is a web interface intended primarily intended to monitor the progress of image reconstruction when
using the ptychography library `PtyPy <https://ptycho.github.io/ptypy>`_.
It is licensed under GPLv2.

In a more general sense PtyDash provides a framework with which data dashboards may be constructed, from data
visualisation plugins referred to as 'cards'.
